# 6. Integrating Green Coding into Development Workflows

Green coding must fit existing workflows to be sustainable.

## 6.1 Local Development

Early profiling and comparison help detect inefficiencies when changes are cheapest.

## 6.2 Code Reviews

Energy-aware questions in reviews promote shared responsibility without rigid enforcement.

## 6.3 Version-Aware Tracking

Linking energy footprint changes to code versions enables trend analysis and regression detection.

## 6.4 CI/CD Integration

Automated feedback should be informational first, with selective scope and context-aware thresholds.

## 6.5 Visualization and Communication

Clear visual feedback helps teams reason about energy trade-offs.

## 6.6 Organizational Adoption

Green coding benefits from cultural support, education, and alignment with business goals.

# 2. Defining Green Coding

## 2.1 What Is Green Coding?

In this guide, green coding is defined as:

> **The design and implementation of software in a way that avoids unnecessary runtime energy and resource consumption while meeting functional and quality requirements.**

This definition emphasizes that the software energy footprint is:
- a **runtime property**
- **workload-dependent**
- shaped by **software decisions**
- observable through **measurement or estimation**

Green coding applies at multiple levels, from individual functions to system architecture, and requires understanding how resource usage translates into energy consumption under real execution conditions.

## 2.2 What Green Coding Is Not

Green coding is not synonymous with performance optimization. While performance and energy footprint are often correlated, faster execution does not always imply lower energy consumption.

Green coding is also not a one-time activity. As software evolves, energy regressions may be introduced through new features, refactoring, or configuration changes.

Finally, green coding is not about premature micro-optimization. Instead, it emphasizes **measured, context-aware decisions** that balance energy efficiency with other quality attributes.

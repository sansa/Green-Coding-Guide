# 7. Trade-offs, Limitations, and Design Tensions

Green coding involves balancing energy footprint against other quality attributes.

## 7.1 CPU vs Memory

Reducing CPU work often increases memory usage. The net energy impact depends on workload and execution time.

## 7.2 Network vs Latency

Reducing data transfer can increase computation. Trade-offs must be evaluated empirically.

## 7.3 Efficiency vs Maintainability

Highly optimized code may be harder to maintain. Long-term sustainability includes maintainability.

## 7.4 Local vs System-Wide Effects

Local optimizations may shift energy consumption elsewhere in the system.

## 7.5 Measurement Uncertainty

Energy measurement has inherent limitations. Results should be interpreted comparatively and transparently.

## 7.6 Diminishing Returns

Beyond major inefficiencies, additional optimization yields marginal energy savings at increasing cost.
